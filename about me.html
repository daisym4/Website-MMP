    <p3> My name is Daisy Martinez and I am currently studying at Borough of Manhattan Community college. I am a Video Arts Technology major and I'm hoping to become a film editor. I've been editing since high school, but then took a break from it to explore my different interests. I recently got back into editing, and have realized that it's something I really enjoy doing. I hope to continue on editing in the future!

    <p3> Since I want to be a film editor, I like to make edits on my free time. Back in highschool I created an edit, decided to upload it onto youtube, and the video is currently at 8.7K views. It's cool to know that 
        8.7K people have watched it, and enjoyed something I created.</p3>
